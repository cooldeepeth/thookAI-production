# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** Every feature that exists in the codebase must actually work end-to-end — a user can sign up, onboard, generate content, schedule, publish, pay, and manage their account without hitting broken flows.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — Infrastructure & Celery

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (Infrastructure & Celery) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-03-31

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: none yet
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 02 P02 | 12 | 2 tasks | 3 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stabilization milestone: Fix existing features before building new ones — no new features until everything works
- Git strategy: All work branches from dev; PRs target dev; never commit to main directly
- PR #30 included: Custom plan builder (pricing pivot) is final direction, merge into dev in Phase 1
- Billing changes: Flag for human review — no auto-merge on billing code
- Verification standard: Manual E2E + automated tests required — 59 existing tests missed real bugs
- [Phase 02]: MongoDB failure in /health returns 503 (critical_down) — load balancers must detect unhealthy state immediately
- [Phase 02]: validate_required_env_vars() fails fast in production, warns in development — clear per-var error messages replace generic config failure

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CONCERNS.md documents race condition in credit deduction (credits.py) — fix required in Phase 5
- Celery files exist (celery_app.py, celeryconfig.py) but Procfile missing worker/beat entries — confirm in Phase 2
- Publishing placeholder in content_tasks.py fallback path — must be replaced in Phase 5
- 20+ worktree-agent-* branches must be deleted before any new branches are created — Phase 1 prerequisite
- Stripe Price IDs are blank in .env.example — owner must create Stripe products; flag in Phase 5
